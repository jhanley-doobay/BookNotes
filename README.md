# Book Notes

This is to serve as a general collection of notes that I am trying to transcribe for books and secondary literature.
I am currently working through Capital again. It's been 8 years since I have read through it, and am looking to go back through it again.
Here's a general index of Authors I am currently setting things up for:

|1|2|3|
|-|-|-|
|[Marx,Karl](./Marx,Karl/Index.md)|[Strauss,Leo](./Strauss,Leo/History%20of%20Political%20Philosophy/Index.md)|[Terranova,Tiziana](./Terranova,Tiziana/Index.md)|
|[Zizek,Slavoj](./Zizek,Slavoj/Index.md)|||
