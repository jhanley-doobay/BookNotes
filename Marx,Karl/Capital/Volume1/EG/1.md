# Chapter 1. Commodities

## 1: The two factors of a commodity:  Use-value and Value (the substance of value in the magnitude value)

### 1.1: Why I start with the commodity

Marx's quote to himself from "a contribution to a critique of political economy", "the wealth of societies in which the capitalist motive production prevails appears as an immense collection of commodities (appears equals takes the form of) the commodity is its elementary form. Why? In the second Germany edition Marx's discussed that of the presentation must differ from its inquiry if done right it will appear as apriori construction. In what does this method of inquiry exist? In Grundrisse (pg 100) Marx says: "starting with a chaotic conception of the whole ... By means of further determination, move analytically towards evermore simple concepts, from the imagined concrete towards ever thinner, abstractions until ... arriving at the simplest determinations ... them from their the journey would have to be retraced." Marx describes his method is moving from the abstract to the concrete, abstract for Marx means not a apriori/arbitrary, but "below "the surface. To not be constructed, but identified. Through method of abstraction (less to more fundamental). Once's this is done we can add secondary determinations. "So if we can see the passage from empirically observed chaotic phenomenon to the simplest determinations, and that from its simplest determinations to the phenomena, now as a rich totality, as two links in a chain, then it is crucial to understanding the method of capital to graph that it is this second link which forms the key to it structure. We are at this stage of exposition simply not privy to the process of investigation – of abstraction – that has proceeded."
Marx's Grundrisse starts from material production/general production (Grundrisse pg 83-5) and conclude with what will be the opening line of capital: "the first category in which bourgeois wealthpresent itself is that of the commodity. (Grundrisse pg 881)". Capital starts with the simplest motive production – abstract labour as a substance value – as the starting point from which additional determinations are layered. This bill to picture of bourgeois society as a rich totality of many determinations and relations.

### 1.2: The use–value of the commodity

if we have to start with the commodity, then we have to define it. Marx defines it as an external object which satisfies human need, desire, or want. The property of this "usefulness" is use-value. Marx claims "usefulness" wise and it's physical properties. Use-value is "only in the use or consumption (Capital PG 126)." While use-value's properties or physical it is also social. It's property exist in relation to human needs. Some also require a level of social/historical development (silicone). If use-value is intrinsic, it is to the extent that it represents a potential.
"use-values," Marx concludes, "constitute the material content of wealth. Whatever it's social form may be (Capital Pg 126). We should not hear the opposition between 'material' and 'social'. Use-value, the property of usefulness or things that bear this property constitute "wealth": the level nature of the wealth of a given society at a given time is given by the nature and quantity of useful things available to it. Wealth in this sense, i.e. use-value, is material: it exist as such independently of the social conditions of its production and consumption. A shoe is a shoe, and it exists and functions as a shoe independently of the social relations under which it is produced and consumed."

## 1.2: the commodities exchange-value

But where the "capitalist motive, production prevails" use-values are also "the material bearers of exchange value”. Since it is precisely the use value, which is the material bearer of exchange value, the latter intrinsic, as a property of the commodity. Mark's observes that certain quantities of commodities a will add a given point in time and given circumstances, "naturally" exchange for X quantity of commodity B, Y quantity of commodity C, Z quantity of commodity D this tells us that commodity a has at least three distinct exchange values at the same time, each of it's listed exchange values are mutually interchangeable the given quantity that one commodity exchanges for a (different) given quantity of another means that a common element of equal magnitude exist in the two different quantities of the two commodities – that each of the commodities in their given quantities are equivalent to, and therefore reduce to a comma third thing which is in itself, neither one nor the other. What then is that third thing? It cannot be a natural aspect. Disregarding qualitative use value, the only thing that is left is the fact that the command is a product of human labour. As abstract human labor, the simple expenditure of physical and mental human labor, and producing something. Commodities are, considered, like this, strip of their use value, nothing more than "congealed" or "crystallized" human labour, measured in time. As congealed labour-time, we can now consider them as values.

### 1.3 Value: its substance, magnitude and form of appearance

Exchange-value as the mode of expression, the "form of appearance", of: "the common factor in the exchange relation, or in the exchange-value of the commodity, is therefore its value." The author asked us to look closely at value itself, independently of its form of appearance.
What is the magnitude of value? It's the labor contained in the article: abstract, labor, measured units of time. If this is the case, that the value of a commodity is determined by the amount of labor time, accumulatively, then why is it not the case that the more labor expanded on the commodity the more value it would have? What Marx reasons is this. The substance of value is the expenditure of human labor, power, independent of form of its expenditure. The total labor power available to society, manifested in the world of commodities, counts as one homogenous mass. It is a labor time required to produce the commodity that forms the substance of its value. This lead us to the following important definition “what exclusively determines the magnitude of the value of any article is therefore the amount of labor, socially necessary or the labor time socially necessary for its production." The value of a commodity will vary with the quantity of socially necessary labor, realized, and its production, but inversely to the productivity of labor realized in its production. Value is therefore not the same as material wealth.

Marx closes this section with two definitions:
First, in regards to the commodity:
"The thing can be a use-value without being a value. This is the case whenever it's utility to man is not mediated through labor. Air, virgin soil, natural meadows, unplanted forest, etc. Fall into this category. A thing can be useful, and the product of human labor, without being a commodity. He who satisfies his own need with the product of his own labor, admittedly, creates use values, but not commodities. In order to produce the latter, he must not only produce use-values, but use-values for others, social use-values. Finally, nothing can be a value without being an object of utility. If the thing is useless, so is the labor contained in it; the labor does not count as labor, and therefore create no value."
Second, regarding value itself: "now we know the substance of value. It is labor. We know the measure of its magnitude. It is labor-time. The form, which stamps value as exchange-value, remains to be analyzed”.

## 2: The twofold character of the labour embodied in commodities

Just as the commodity has a dual character so does labor we shall first consider labor from the useful point of view, before looking at it as it's represented in value.

### 2.1 Useful labour

Two commodities confront each other: a coat, and 10 yards of linen. We assume that the value of the coat is twice that of linen, such that if 10 yards of linen=W, the coat=2W.
As use-values the coat and linen confront each other as qualitatively different; equally, the two types of useful labor do so as well. The existence of a heterogeneous mass of useful labor – a certain level of development of the social division of labor – is a precondition of commodity production. Commodity exchange and therefore production is premise on a certain level of development of the social division of labor, the specialization of labor.

Nonetheless, while a division of labor is a necessary precondition of commodity production, it is not so for the production of use values. For this ladder, what is indispensable is labor itself:
"Men made clothes for thousands of years, under the compulsion of the need for clothing, without a single man ever becoming a tailor. But the existence of coats, of linen, of every element of material wealth, not provided in advanced by nature, had always to be mediated through a specific productive activity appropriate to its purpose, a productive activity that assimilated particular natural materials to particular human requirements. Labor, then, as the creator of use values, as useful labor, as a condition of human existence, which is independent of all forms of society: it is the eternal natural necessity which mediates the metabolism between man and nature, and therefore human life itself (Capital PG 133).”
"When man engages in production, he can only proceed as nature does herself, i.e. he can only exchange the form of materials (Capital PG 133).”

### 2.2 'Value-producing' labour

The coat and the linen confront each other as values: that one coat equals 10 yards of line expresses a quantitative difference. This means they confront each other as qualitative equals: as we have seen products of equal, homogenous labor. They are the expenditure of human labor-power, and it is this better qualitatively distinct use-values to confront each other as qualitative equals. It is not something that pertains to the commodities themselves, but something social: social labor.

Mark's introduces the concept of "simple labor-power": “labor-power possessed in his bodily organism by every ordinary man”. The coat and linen are values if abstracted from their use-values; the labor that produces them as represented by their values if abstracted from its useful purpose. But coats and linen do not confront each other as values, but as values of a certain magnitude. If the productivity of these labors doubles, then one coat will be worth half of what one was worth before, since only half the labor time will be necessary to produce it. The effect is reversed if productivity falls. And increase in the quantity of use-values produce signifies, increase in material wealth produced, but it does not follow that an increase in material wealth cannot correspond to fall in the magnitude of value produced. That this is the case arises from the dual character of labor: "productivity" pertains to useful, concrete labor. "In reality this productivity determines only the degree of effectiveness of productive activity directed towards a given purpose within a given period of time."
The dual character of labor does not signify two different types of labor. "It follows from the proceeding, not that there are two differing kinds of labor working in the commodity, but rather that the same labor is specified and differing, and even contradictory manner – in accordance with whether it is related to the use-value of the commodity as laborers, product or related to the commodity – values as it's merely objective expression just as the commodity must be above all else, an object of use in order to be a value, just so does labor have to be before all else useful labor – purposeful, productive activity – in order to count as expenditure of human labor-power, and hence a simple human labor"

Marx summarises:
“On the one hand, all labor is an expenditure of human labor – power and the physiological sense, and it is in this quality of being equal to human labor, or abstract, human labor, that it forms the value of commodities. On the one hand, all labor is an expenditure of human labor-power in a particular form and with a definitive theme and it is in this quality of being concrete useful labor that it produces use–values.”

## 3: The form of value or exchange value

(The purpose of this section (3) is to show how and why the money form comes to exist)

A commodity has a dual form: a bodily form, and a value form. The substance of the value of the community, the abstract, human labor, and its magnitude the quantity of abstract, social necessary labor for its production: what is the form of its value?

Commodities possess the character of values only and so far as they are expressions of a "identical, social substance, human labor, their character as values thus a social character in exchange. The substance of the value of the commodity is abstract, human labor, its magnitude the quantity of abstract labor, socially necessary for its production. It is not adequate to say that the value of commodity is X units of social, we necessary, labor, since labor is not the measure of value, it is value: the value of a certain quantity of commodity a equals X units of socially necessary labor is the same as saying that the value of a certain quantity of commodity a equals, the value of a certain quantity of commodity a and we have resolved nothing.

What Marx argues is this. A commodity is at the same time both a use value, and a value. Value is a quantitative property that commodities share in common. Commodities can exist as values only to the extent that they are composed of this common, social substance, human labor, and that, therefore, value itself is a social phenomena that, despite its objective existence, only manifest itself in the social exchange of commodities. Commodity a as a commodity will never be exchanged for itself, but always for another commodity. Value can only be expressed, can only be ascertained, can only manifest itself, when a commodity enters into an exchange relation with another commodity.

"Not an atom of matter, enters into the objectivity of commodities as values; in this it is the direct opposite of the course we sent objectivity of commodities as physical objects. We may twist and turn a single commodity as we wish; it is impossible to grasp it as a thing possessing value. However, let us remember that commodities is possess an objective character. They value only in so far as they are all expressed of an identical, social substance, human that the objective character as values is therefore purely social. From this it follows self – evidently that it can only appear in the social relation between commodity and commodity. (Capital 138-9)”

The aim will be “to perform a task, never even attempted by bourgeois economics ”: “to show the origin of the money form (Capital 139)”. What Marx will do, through examining the exchange relations of commodities in increasingly complex forms, will be to identify the logical necessity of money.

### 3.A The simple, isolated, or accidental form of value

### 3.A.1 The Two Poles of the Expression of value

![Barter as X Commodity A = Y Commodity B, 20 yards of linen = 1 coat](./Img/1/1.png)

First, we considered the simplest possible form of commodity exchange, the exchange of one commodity for another i.e. barter. The coat and the linen not only fulfill different roles in the relation, their roles are mutually exclusive, even though at the same time they belong to and mutually conditioned each other. Because the rules of these two commodities are different, they must have different use values: one cannot express the value of commodity in itself, only in another commodity. Because the rules of commodities are different the equation is reversible, but not symmetrical.

### 3.A.2 The relative form of value

#### 3.A.2.i The [qualitative] content of the relative form of value

First the equation 20 yards of linen = 1 coat says, independently of the proportions involved that like is being compared with like. Second, that the two quantitatively equated commodities do not fulfill the same role in the relation.

By equating the linen with the coat, we are saying that the two kinds of labor involved, by virtue of being human labor in general, are both value–creating labors. But the value created by the labor expended on commodity can only be expressed in objective form as something materially different from that commodity. "Human labor – power in its fluid state, or human labor, creates value, but it is not itself value. It becomes value in it, coagulated state, in objective form (Capital 142).”

#### 3.A.2.ii The quantitative determinacy of the relative form of value

The exchange revision 20 yards of linen = 1 coat and not only expresses like with like, value with value, but a specific quantitative relation reducible to the quantity of labor expended in the production of the two commodities. Should the same kinds of changes in productivity occur in coat making, then to the equivalent relations would change. Thus, the same changes in relative value may arise from opposed causes: either a change in value of the relative form, or a change in value in the equivalent form, or some combination of movements and either the same or different directions.

#### 3.A.2.iii the equivalent form

By functioning as the equivalent, the coat acquires the property of being exchangeable with the linen. The magnitude of the value of linen is given by the quantity of coats – by the labor-time necessary for their production – that appears in relation.

Marx identifies three peculiarities of the equivalent form that reveal themselves from this.

1. use-value takes on the form of its 'opposite', value.
2. concrete labor takes on the form or manifestation of its 'opposite', abstract human labor
3. private labor takes on the form of its 'opposite', labor in immediately social form.

#### 3.A.2.1 The Three Peculiarities & Critique of Aristotle

1. First Peculiarity: A definite number of coats can express the value of a definite quantity of linen, but they can never express the magnitude of their own value. No commodity can: it must always relate to its own value in the form of a body of an equivalent. Use-value, the coat, becomes the form of appearance of its "opposite", value. That the relative value form the linen our example, expresses its value in a form different from itself suggest an underlying social relation. But with regard to the equivalent form the reverse is true: that the material commodity the use value itself expresses value appears to rise from a natural property of the commodity itself.

2. Second Peculiarity: Even though it functions as the bodily expression of abstract, human labor, the equivalent (coats in our example) is itself the product of a specific type of useful labor, (tailoring in our example). Does this concrete labor stands as the expression of general human labor; tailoring in our example becomes "abstract human laborers form of realization (Capital pg 150).” What is peculiar here is not that labor can be considered as abstract labor, but that concrete labor actually becomes the form of manifestation of abstract labor.

3. Third Peculiarity: Because of the previous peculiarity, that concrete labor, (e.g. tailoring) functions as the kind of expression of general labor, it (concrete labor) takes on the form of equality with other kinds of labor. Although, like all commodity-producing labor, it is performed privately, it is as an expression of general labor, labor, and directly social form. As such, it present itself in a form which is directly exchangeable with other commodities.

4. Aristotle: Marx criticizes a passage from Aristotle. He complemented him of discovering that exchange depends on commensurability, and interestingly notes that his failure to identify that commensurability is based on value was an inevitable consequence of economic relations of his time: “However, Aristotle himself was unable to extract this fact that in the form of commodity values, all labor is expressed as equal human labor, and therefore as labor of equal quality. Greek society was founded on the labor of slaves, hence had its natural basis, the inequality of men, and of their labor-powers. The secret of the expression of value, namely, the equality and equivalent of all kinds of labor, because and in so far as they are human labor in general, could not be deciphered, until the concept of human equality had already acquired the permanence of a fixed popular opinion. This, however, becomes possible only in a society where the commodity form is the universal form of the product of labor, hence the dominant social relation is the relation between men as possessors of commodities."

#### 3.A.2.iv The simple form of value considered as a whole

In the simple form of value, the value of commodity is independently expressed as exchange-value. What the simple form has shown is that exchange-value, the expression of value of the commodity, emerges from the nature of commodity value; rather than value and its magnitude emerging from their mode of expression as exchange-value.

Such a development is historically specific: "the product of labor is an object of utility and all states of society; but it is only a historically septic epoch of development, which presents the labor expended in the production of a useful article as a objective property of that article i.e. as it's value. It is only then that the product of labor becomes transformed into a commodity” (Capital pg 153-4).

Marx turns to its ‘insufficiency’ (and by insufficiency we should understand a logical rather than a practical insufficiency – although Marx does emphasize that the simple form of value is a real historical phenomenon (Capital pg 153-4)). By appearing in an exchange-relation, with only one other commodity, the commodity in the relative form is unable to express its qualitative equality and quantitative proportionality to other commodities in general; by the same token, the commodity occupying the equivalent form only expresses its exchangeability with one other commodity.

### 3.B The total or expanded form of value

![Expanded form of Value, z A = u B = v C...](./Img/1/2.png)
20 yards of linen = 1 coat || 20 yards of linen = 10 lbs of tea || 20 yards of linen = 2 oz gold || ...

#### 3.B.1 The expanded relative form of value

The proliferation of equivalence, we now see now really reveals the labor that created the linen as a quantity of undifferentiated human labor, for it now counts as the equal of every other sort. The magnitude of the line now cannot be accidental: now, it is clear "that it is not the exchange of commodities which regulates the magnitude of their values, but the magnitude of the value of commodities which regulates the proportion in which they exchange” (Capital pg 156).

#### 3.B.2 The particular equivalent form

Now, in addition, each concrete labor represented as equivalent stands as a particular form of manifestation of human labor in general.

#### 3.B.3 Defects of the total or expanded form of value

Mark's points out the "defects quote of the form. From the point of view of the relative form, the form is:

1. Necessary we incomplete, since there is always the possibility of the appearance of another commodity in the chain of equivalents;
2. Lacking in simplicity, precisely because human labor in general is represented as a disparate range of concrete labors;
3. Not uniform, given that in the equivalent position every commodity except that in the relative position appears means that every commodity has a different series of equivalents.

From the POV of the equivalent form is:

1. Limited, since each natural equivalent form exist, amongst innumerable other possible ones, each of which excludes all the others;
2. Not generalized, since each form of labor, appearing as the commodity-equivalent is a concrete form of labor.

Within the form itself lies the logical resolution to its defects if the form is, in effect, the sum of numerable, simple value forms, and each implies itself reverse then we arrive at:

### 3.C The general form of value

![General Commodities that each individually come to equal 20 yards of linen](./Img/1/3.png)

#### 3.C.1 The changed character of the form of value

The two previous forms - the simple and expanded form of value - were only able to express the value of commodity is something distinct from its own use-value; neither includes an expression of value common to all commodities, for, for each commodity, all other commodities can only appear in the form of equivalent. Now, all commodities, except that in the equivalent form, appear to each other as qualitatively equal and quantitatively proportional as values in general and as values whose magnitude can be compared.

What of the equivalent? Now, it is directly exchangeable with all other commodities, i.e. it can be used to buy things. The general value form is "the social expression of the world of commodities.” It makes “clear that within this world, the general human character of labor forms it specific social nature” (Capital pg 160).

#### 3.C.2 The development of the relative and equivalent forms of value: their interdependence

Earlier Marx characterize the equivalent value form as "passive"; now he returns to the point. "The degree of development of the relative form of value, and that of the equivalent form, correspond. But we must bear in mind that the development of the equivalent form is only the expression and the result of development of the relative form" (Capital pg 160). Thus a universal equivalent appears because the other commodities make it the embodiment of their universal form of value.

#### 3.C.3 The transition from the general form of value to the money form

In principle, any commodity can function as the universal equivalent; but to do so, they must stand alone as excluded from the commodities that stand in the relative position. Once this happens, the universal function as money. This leads us to:

### 3.D The money form

![General Commodities that each individually come to equal 2 oz of gold](./Img/1/4.png)

What differentiates this form from the previous is the use value of the commodity that functions as a general equivalent. Once gold functions as money, the simple expression of the relative value of a single commodity is the price form. Nevertheless "gold confronts the other commodities as money only because it previously confronted them as a commodity” (Capital pg 162).

## 4: The fetishistic character of the commodity and its secret

### 4.1 In what does the mysteriousness of the commodity consist

A commodity, is a mysterious thing. What is mysterious about a commodity transcend sensuousness. Marx answers: what is mysterious about the commodity is the commodity-form itself the product of labor assumes in mysterious character, as soon as it assumes the commodity-form. What mysterious really means here, is:

1. That the equality of different kinds of human labor takes on physical form and the equality of the products of labor as values;
2. That the measure of human labor takes on the form of the magnitude of value of the products of labor;
3. That the relations between the producers take on the form of a social relation between the products of labor

In short: “that the mysterious character of the commodity-form consist simply in the fact that the commodity reflects the social characteristics of men's own labor as objective characteristics of the products of labor themselves, as Socio-natural properties of these things. Hence, it also reflects the social relation of producers to the sum, total of labor as a social relation between objects, relation, which exists apart from and outside the producers” (Capital 164-5).

Hence, the quote fetishism which attaches itself to the products of labor " (Capital 165). Here, marks uses the term fetishism and it's original - religious – sense, in the sense that in certain religious practices, supernatural properties are imputed to material objects (the catholic doctrine of transubstantiation would be a good modern day example of religious fetishism). With commodity exchange, the fact that human relations are manifested in the relations between things is taken not as the manifestation of human relations, but as something arising from the natural properties of the things themselves. This is the mystery we are investigating.

### 4.2 From where does the mysteriousness of the commodity come from

In short, from the particular social character of commodity producing labor: because commodities are the product of private labor of individuals who work independently of each other, and to only come into social contact through the exchange of products of their labor, through the relations exchange establishes between these products and, through their mediation, between the producers."The social relations between private labors appear as they are” (Capital 166). That under commodity exchange human relations appeared to be manifested in the relations between things is because they are manifested in the relation between things.
Commodities as products of labor, acquire, social objectivity as values through exchange. The social objectivity is distinct from the materially varied objectivity, commodities embodied as use-values. This does not mean that producers are unaware of the demands of the market when they are producing. The division of the product into use-value and value occurs. Once exchange itself is sufficiently widespread for the producer, labor itself, acquires a twofold character, both as useful labor, and value, producing labor, for now asked to fulfill two functions: first, it must fill a social media second, it must satisfy the need of the producer, and that her particular useful private labor must be exchangeable.

Therefore, "men do not bring the products of their labor into relation with each other as values because they see these objects merely as the material integuments of homogenous human labor. The reverse is true: by equating their different products to each other in exchange as values, they equate their different kinds of labors as human labor. They do this without being aware of it” (Capital 166).

### 4.3 The limits of political economy

What is there for mysterious is what this water consist of: value, therefore, does not have its description branded on its forehead; it rather transforms every product of labor into a social hieroglyphic" (Capital 166). Marx’s criticism here is that by limiting itself to deciphering the hieroglyphic bourgeois, political economy fails to address why it is a hieroglyphic for classical political economy that the social character private labors manifest itself as value appears not as something specific to commodity production, but as something eternally true to human production, it sees the production of commodities as eternally true human production:

“Something which is only valid for this particular form of production, the production of commodities, namely, the fact that the specific social character and private labors carried on independently of each other consists in their quality as human labor, and, in the product, assume the form of the existence of value, appears to those caught up in the relations of commodity production to be just as ultimately valid as the fact that the scientific dissection of the air into its component parts left the atmosphere itself on altered in its physical configuration” (Capital 167).

Marx examines three: in each, he will identify the three "essential determinations value " - the expenditure of human labor power, the social significance of labor time, and the existence of interactions between the producers through which their laborers assume a social form.

1. Robinson Crusoe: In Robinsons, one person "economy", he employees different forms of labor to satisfy his needs, he organizes his time and his resources; and even though "all of the relations between Robinson and the objects that form his self-created wealth are so simple those relations contain all the essential determinants of value"
2. Medieval Europe: The social relations of material production are characterized by relations of personal dependence. The natural form of labor is its particularity, not its generality. The corvée is measured in time. Here, personal relations are not disguised in the form of the relations between things.
3. The Patriarchal Pesant Family: The family produces use values for its own use. The labor deployed is already social is regulated by age, gender, custom, seasons, etc. Again, the determination of value or present, but the social relations are transparent.
4. An Association Of Free Individuals: Individual labor powers are social, but allocated consciously; the product is a social product. Once again, "social relations are transparent in their simplicity” (Capital 172).

Hence, again we arrive at what is historically specific about the commodity-form: that the commodity reflects the social characteristics of men's own labor as objective characteristics of the products of labor themselves, as a socio-natural properties of these things. Hence, it also reflects the social relation of the producers to the some total of labor as a sofa, relation between objects, a relation which exists apart from and outside the producers” (Capital 164-5).
“It is one of the chief failings of classical political economy, that it is never succeeded, by means of its analysis of commodities, and in particular of their value, and discovering the form of value in which, in fact turns value into exchange-value. Even it's best representatives, Adam Smith, and Ricardo, treat the form of value as something of indifference, something external to the nature of the commodity its the explanation for this is not simply that their attention is entirely absorbed by the analysis of the magnitude of value. It lies deeper. The value form of the product of waiver is the most abstract, but also the most universal form of the bourgeois motive production; by the fact that it stamps the bourgeois mode of production as a particular kind of social production of a historical and transitory character. If we make the mistake of treating it as the eternal natural form of social production, we necessarily overlook the specific of value form, and consequently, that of the commodity-form together with its further development, the money form, the capital form, etc.” (Capital 174)
